* G+ and Facebook pages, + link to them
* A staging site
* bin/fetch_docs.rb should deal with new structure (multi-repo) for 6.0
* Should build and publish Javadocs as a part of this site
* Javadocs multi-repo from 6.0 as well
* Update Gemfile to use a released version of Awestruct (rather than from a git repo!) once it renders AsciiDoc properly.  Possibly try Awestruct release > 0.5.3
